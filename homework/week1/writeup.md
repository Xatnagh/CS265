so the solution i found online was : " wc -l * "


Broken down, I think wc means word count, which is built into the unix system, -l is the flag that means line, so we are counting lines in each file, and the  * means all files in current directory. So translated to be count all lines for current directory. Im not exactly sure why it also displays the total. 

I think bash is better for this task as it uses fewer lines. however the python have more flexibility in text manipulation and interpretation as oppose to bash. So bash is faster at doing simple tasks fast, but python is for anything that requires multiple steps to perform.
